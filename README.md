- **CSS3:** For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript:** For fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the UI.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** To retrieve real-time weather data.

## Challenges

### Technical Challenge

One of the most significant technical challenges was optimizing API requests to ensure the app remained within the free-tier rate limits provided by OpenWeatherMap. Implementing a caching mechanism to reduce the number of API calls while maintaining up-to-date information was crucial. This challenge required a deep understanding of API limitations and effective data management strategies.

### Non-Technical Challenge

Managing time effectively was a major non-technical challenge. Balancing this project with other responsibilities required careful prioritization and constant reassessment of deadlines. Effective communication and flexibility were key to overcoming this challenge and ensuring the project's progress.

## Future Improvements

- **Add Forecast Feature:** Include a 5-day weather forecast to provide users with more comprehensive weather information.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Implement backgrounds that change according to the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- **User Preferences:** Allow users to save their favorite locations for quicker access.
